 atm_challenge_2021
# The code
 The atm_challenge is a  simple ruby based project,
 In order to produce good quality code,we work in a test driven way and unit test this coade 
 According to the requirements and logical needs set by the course material we need to have a  ATM machine, 
 a withdrawer and a deposit, so we write the code based on these（ATM/Account/Person) three classes to complete the whole project.

# Dependencies
Game framework we used Rspec for unit test

# Setup
We’ll be write our application using Test Driven Development(RSpec),In order to be able to use it we need to install it.
There are two ways to install libraries (gems). 
A direct install from your terminal(gem install rspec)
.$ gem install bundler
or by adding a gem as a dependency to your application using Bundler ,you just add a gem to a specific file named Gemfile.
And run bundle install again.
The next step is to initialize RSpec and configure it for our needs.
.$ rspec --init
Edit the .rspec file and add --format documentation to see a more verbose rspec output. 
.rspec file needs to look like this.
--format documentation
--color
--require spec_helper

# Acknowledgements
Thanks to the in-depth analysis of the teacher on the course materials, so that I can have enough confidence to complete them in the future challenges. 
Thanks to classmate Giovanni for helping to optimize my code in time when encountering problems and let me better understand where my problems are.

# Updates/Improvements plans
Because it is in the early stage of learning coding, I haven’t found any areas for improvement,
because my knowledge has not reached the point where I can find problems, but in the future I will be more proficient in programming. 
I will check this project. Optimize it

# Licensethe
 All of our projects will be under the MIT-license during this course.
